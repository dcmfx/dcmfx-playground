never leave your device.

## Features ‚ú®

1. View the content of DICOM and DICOM JSON files.

2. Convert between DICOM files and DICOM JSON files.

3. Rewrite DICOM files to ensure they have correct headers, change their string encoding to UTF-8,
   and correct errors that may prevent use in other software.

DCMfx Playground is written in [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com). Install the Dioxus CLI with
`cargo install dioxus-cli`, then run `dx serve` to start the dev server.
